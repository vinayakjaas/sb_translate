    "content": "Users can choose their Ministry/Department/Organization to specify what they need. This helps ensure that the content generated is relevant and fits their specific entity. Additionally, users can select their level/role within their chosen entity to further customize the content to meet their specific responsibilities and requirements. The system also considers the user's preferred language, so they can choose how they want the content to be presented. This means the generated content will be in a language that the user understands comfortably. Once the user makes their selections, the system automatically creates tailored content based on their context, role, and language preference. This content can include various materials like documents, reports, guidelines, and training materials. If the user chooses a language different from the default language of the content, the system will smoothly translate the generated content into the selected language. This allows officials to access the content in their preferred language, promoting better understanding and communication. The user interface (UI) for this feature is integrated with the IGOT Portals. These are online platforms used for government training and information sharing. The integration ensures that the generated and translated content is readily available within the existing IGOT Portals. This makes it easy for officials to access and use the content for their training and reference needs. ● Set up the Angular project and integrate it with the necessary backends and APIs. ● Develop the frontend components, services, and UI elements for user selection, content display, and language preferences. ● Implement the server-side logic for content generation based on user selections. ● Integrate with the translation service or third-party translation API for translating the generated content. ● Test the integration with backends and ensure smooth communication between frontend and backend components."
